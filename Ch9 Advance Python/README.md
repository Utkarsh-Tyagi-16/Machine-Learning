# 📜 Advanced Python Concepts: Iterators, Generators, and Decorators

Welcome to the **Advanced Python Concepts** repository! In this project, we cover important Python concepts like **Iterators**, **Generators**, and **Decorators** to enhance your understanding of Python programming. These are essential for writing efficient, scalable, and maintainable code.

## 🔄 Iterators

An **Iterator** in Python is an object that contains a countable number of elements. It implements the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods, which allow us to iterate through items one by one.

### 🌟 Key Points:
- **Efficient looping**: Iterators help in looping through large datasets efficiently.
- **No need for indexing**: You can traverse elements without exposing the underlying data structure.

## 🌀 Generators

**Generators** are special iterators that generate values lazily, meaning they produce items only when needed, reducing memory usage. They are defined using the `yield` keyword.

### 🌟 Key Points:
- **Memory Efficient**: Values are not stored in memory, but produced on the fly.
- **Easy to implement**: Just use `yield` to make any function a generator.

## 🎨 Decorators

**Decorators** are a powerful tool in Python that allows us to modify the behavior of a function or method without changing its code. They are used to **wrap** another function, adding some functionality before or after it runs.

### 🌟 Key Points:
- **Code Reusability**: Add extra functionality without modifying the original function.
- **Readable and DRY**: Decorators allow you to follow the "Don't Repeat Yourself" principle.

## 📚 Advanced Example: Generators for Large Files

This example shows how to use a generator to **read large files** efficiently.

### 🌟 Key Points:
- **Scalable**: Ideal for reading large files line by line without loading the entire file into memory.
