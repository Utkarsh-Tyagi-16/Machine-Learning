# 🗂️ File Handling and OS Operations in Python

This repository demonstrates essential file handling and OS operations using Python. Below is a brief overview of the different operations you can perform with the provided code.

## 📄 Reading a File

You can read the entire content of a text file. This is useful for processing or displaying the contents of a file.

## ✍️ Writing to a File

This allows you to write text to a file. Be cautious as this operation will overwrite the file if it already exists, replacing all existing content with the new text.

## ➕ Appending to a File

Instead of overwriting, you can append new text to the end of an existing file. This is particularly handy when you need to add information to a log file or data file over time.

## 🛠️ Handling Binary Files

### Writing to a Binary File

Binary files store data in binary format (0s and 1s). You can write raw bytes to a binary file, which is useful for non-text data such as images or executables.

### Reading from a Binary File

You can read the raw byte data from a binary file. This allows you to process or manipulate binary data.

## 📝 Copying a File

This operation reads content from a source file and writes it to a destination file. It's useful for creating backups or duplicating files.

## 🔢 Counting Lines, Words, and Characters

This functionality allows you to count the number of lines, words, and characters in a text file. It's helpful for text processing or analytics.

## 🔄 Writing and Reading in the Same Operation

You can write data to a file and then immediately read it back using the same file handle. This operation is efficient when you need to confirm the contents you just wrote.

## 🖥️ OS Module Operations

### 📂 Getting the Current Working Directory

This operation retrieves the current working directory, helping you understand the context in which your script is running.

### 🆕 Creating a New Directory

You can create a new directory (folder) in your current working directory. This is useful for organizing files or setting up new project environments.

### 📜 Listing Files and Directories

This lists all files and directories within a specified directory. It helps in navigating and managing the file system programmatically.

### 🔗 Joining Paths

Path joining helps create a valid file path by combining directory and file names. It's crucial for cross-platform file manipulation.

### ❓ Checking if a Path Exists

You can check if a specific file or directory exists on the filesystem, preventing errors when attempting to access or manipulate files.

### 🔍 Checking if a Path is a File or Directory

This operation helps determine whether a given path is a file or a directory, aiding in conditional file processing.

### 🛤️ Getting the Absolute Path

This retrieves the absolute path of a file, ensuring your script can correctly locate and access files regardless of the current working directory.
